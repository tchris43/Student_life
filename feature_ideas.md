# Help students learn how to manage their time, and make it easier for them to plan (don't just make decisions for them)

- drag and drop assignments with time estimate and priority weights (based on time - Maybe user input on importance)
- opportunity cost
- insights on how they spend their time
- grade affecting calculator/ prioritize based on class weights
- upcoming test prepper
- test study helper
- motivate with things similar to SSC
- prioritize goals

  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# New Way of Learning
- class prep module/ class review module

# Planning helper
- how long will it take
- balance work, school, social
- When should I start working on this task
- How much will this affect my grade?
- Auto-generate to-do list
- Quick daily look (how do we cater better than learning suite and canvas?)

# Quality of Life
- help point out resources available

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Assumptions
- Most students work on a task-to-task, due date triage mind-set
- Many students underestimate the time it will take for them to complete homework, and end up submitting mediocre work
- Most students struggle to balance work, school, and social because they genuinely don't have enough time to do everything they want to. They overbook themselves every week
- Most students don't work ahead of schedule when they should, because they are just trying to keep their head above water, and when nothing is immediately due, they finally get some treasured free-time
- Most students have a desire to do well on an assignment until they get behind
- Many students don't plan simply because it is not convenient to see what is coming up, and how long it will all take, and how important each thing is to their grade
- Many students would rather just see a dashboard of what is coming up so that they can work on that, but it would be nice for the dashboard to be more organized to what really matters and to sort of look ahead and have tasks like "study for test" in there.
- Some students don't realize there are resources because they are scattered throughout BYU websites. (Financial, academic, career, health etc.)

# Hypothesis'
- ~If I try to change the way students work, many won't really care (they're used to the triage mindset)
- ~Even if students know how long something will take, they'll most likely still procrastinate because they have so much to do
- ~It may be more helpful to have a more "prioritized schedule" rather than a more "efficient schedule"
- #Students would be more likely to work ahead if they could see that doing so would protect their free-time to do what they want to do and simultaneously lead to their academic goals
- ~Students would be more likely to plan ahead if their was an easy spot to look and see everything that was coming up.
- -->Students would be even more likely to stay on top of things if they could just see a good dashboard (maybe with suggestions of when to start things, and actually doable tasks rather than deadlines and things they could check-off) that they didn't have to do any extra work for
- #Students would be more likely to use resources if there were suggestions catered specifically toward their situation


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Plans to test Hypothesis'
- Maybe I can make a sample image of what it could look like (upcoming tasks with priority based on class importance - or maybe desired grade, time estimated, and grade-weight) including new tasks that break down assignments, or help you know when to start studying for a test and then ask people if it would help them to be successful if they had a dashboard like that?
- Is there a way that I could actually quickly show people what this would look like for their own schedule?
