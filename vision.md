# Pain points we are trying to solve:
Students are so busy, that they tend to focus on just the immediate "fires" in front of them, and end up having to cram for tests, or do mediocre work on big assignments because they are forced to procrastinate. 

When students fall behind, they sometimes miss out on TA help and other resources because they run out of time. 

It is hard for students to plan ahead to break up tasks or know when to start tasks because it takes so long to do this.

# Ideas to solve it:
We can help students feel confident that they will complete the many little assignments on time while helping them look ahead and chip away at bigger tasks along the way. This will help students to really learn the material well and succeed in their classes in a more consistent way.

# Prototype functionality:
On the right side, we will have a list of what is due this week listed with it's due date (day of the week) and the estimated time it will take to complete it.

Beneath that, we will have a list of big things that are coming up in the next week or two, their due dates, and how long they will take.

The bulk of the page will be broken up by days of the week. The user can input how many hours they have each day to work on homework, and using AI, we can automatically suggest how they should break apart their big assignments, and what tasks they should focus on each day (giving a time estimate with each task.)

The idea is that they will still complete the small tasks on time, but sometimes they will work on something that is further out just to get started on a big project rather than working on something due sooner because they can do that another day. 

It will prioritize when to start tasks based on:
- when they are due
- how long they will take
- and how much they will affect their grade

# Vision for the app:
The vision is that we will not replace any meaningful learning opportunities, rather we will enhance them. We are giving the students a resource that will inform them on how they can break up their time to succeed, not a tool that will make decisions for them. 

This way we will help students become life-long learners rather than just being focused on getting the "badges" of the grade they want. They will be more focused on mastering the concepts, and learning with integrity instead of doing mediocre work or using dishonest methods to complete the work on time.
