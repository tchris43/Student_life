Provided very good insight about how the problem isn't always that students need to schedule their time more effectively, but it's actually that students don't know how to learn effectively. They should be primed before classes, and review the material after and possibly do spaced review. This can be done with AI, but to set that up takes lots of time and effort so if the app already understood all of the classes and the AI knew what assignments are coming up, it could help them prepare for class, do their homework, protect free time, and learn in a truly meaningful way. 

Some students expressed a desire to know how long assignments would take so that they could better plan their time. 

Many talked about how they find it hard to balance work, school, and social life. Especially those with less economic resources who have to work a lot. --> Maybe they were not aware of resources available at BYU because they are first generation. 

Others suggested an alarm for an assignment, and I think this suggests the idea that people need to know when to start working on an assignment, not just knowing when something is due. 

Some wanted to know how much each assignment would affect their grade.

Some wanted to just have a to-do list auto-generated for them.

There are also some who just simply keep track of things in their head, and have "work times" and "free times" and just look everyday to see what they need to get done.

Feedback on mockup:
-Struggle with planning ahead for finals—> really helping me to plan ahead studying for tests instead of cramming. Breaking up finals 
-Just uses prioritized for daily tasks
-Probably use laptop
--use in daily life

-For high time demand major
-maybe wouldn’t naturally try but may try it out for lack of better system 
-bring canvas and learning suite
-probably use laptop 
(try not to have phone out to focus)
-but quick check or notification on phone
-People have talked about this for a long time

-more likely to check grades and tasks on phone, but use laptop to figure out what to do
-I have this much time til next class how can I get these things done in this amount of time? Based on priority —> study session calculator
-Notify you when TA hours start or suggest resources when struggling
-Toggle which notifications you want or have a separate view
-How long did you spend? How difficult? Product review to help the model understand you more. And give more accurate times based on other students.
-Professors could look at the cards and see what it looks like
——> most useful to automatically compile from all sites and give a to-do list for the day 

-combine all calendars
-Likes calendar form
-pull assignments automatically into one place 
-especially integrate into personal calendar
-Pull so you don’t miss stuff
-Different colors for each class
-Notifications that you can toggle
-see how your grades get affected by scores
-Update grades more often and tell you about it
-How much time did it take students in the past?
-Manually check-off the dashboard
-Start studying for this now notification 


-pulling all to one dashboard
-Maybe wouldn’t want to do test early
-Incorporating study as an assignment 
-But the app would help her to see that she should do the test prep instead of putting it off and she can do the small assignment tomorrow

-uses prioritizer but always forgets to work on stuff in the future because he’s focusing on the small fires right in front of him
-Wants a secondary prioritizer that helps him work a little on things after he does the urgent things


-bigger blocks for bigger tasks
-visual prioritizer
