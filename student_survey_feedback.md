Provided very good insight about how the problem isn't always that students need to schedule their time more effectively, but it's actually that students don't know how to learn effectively. They should be primed before classes, and review the material after and possibly do spaced review. This can be done with AI, but to set that up takes lots of time and effort so if the app already understood all of the classes and the AI knew what assignments are coming up, it could help them prepare for class, do their homework, protect free time, and learn in a truly meaningful way. 

Some students expressed a desire to know how long assignments would take so that they could better plan their time. 

Many talked about how they find it hard to balance work, school, and social life. Especially those with less economic resources who have to work a lot. --> Maybe they were not aware of resources available at BYU because they are first generation. 

Others suggested an alarm for an assignment, and I think this suggests the idea that people need to know when to start working on an assignment, not just knowing when something is due. 

Some wanted to know how much each assignment would affect their grade.

Some wanted to just have a to-do list auto-generated for them.

There are also some who just simply keep track of things in their head, and have "work times" and "free times" and just look everyday to see what they need to get done.
