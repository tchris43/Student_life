-Would you be interested in an app that lets you check off assignments, and has a to do list of upcoming assignments?
-Would you be interested in an app that motivates you to do your work with rewards? What rewards?
-Would it be helpful to be alerted a few weeks before your test to give you ideas on preparing for your test, and having some in-app ways to help you study once it gets closer?
