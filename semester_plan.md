# Student_life: Semester Plan

Below is a plan primarily generated by Gemini 3 with the following prompt:
I want you to create a Plan for me starting today and lasting the rest of winter semester at BYU. 
I am a software Engineering student who is working with a professor to build an app. The app will help students organize their schedule so they can stay on top of homework and studying. 
I will be talking to students to gather info, reading "the lean startup" and potentially watching videos about starting businesses, spending time planning the app and writing pseudo code,
building an mvp, testing, debugging, maybe talking to entrepreneuers occasionally, learning about how to deploy and market an app, have incentives plans for promotions of milestones, and 
just watching tutorials to learn how to do all these things since I am inexperienced. My professor will  help however. Can you (keeping in mind major events, finals, midterms, holidays) 
build a plan for me including milestones of when I should get to which goal with these hour constraints:
I will work around 15 hours a week, but five of those hours will be a meeting with my professor (1 hour a day). Please do this in a format that I can easily edit.

Here is the plan formatted in clean, organized Markdown. You can easily copy and paste this into any markdown editor (like Obsidian, Notion, or GitHub) to edit it as your semester progresses.

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Customer Discovery & Validation

**Timeline:** Weeks 2 – 4 (Jan 16 – Feb 6)
**Goal:** Confirm the problem exists before writing heavy code.

* **Tasks:**
* [ ] Read *The Lean Startup* (Chapters 1–4 focus).
* [ ] Interview 10–15 BYU students about their current scheduling pain points.
* [ ] Watch "Starting a Startup" Y-Combinator videos on YouTube.


* **Professor Focus:** Refining the "Value Proposition" based on student feedback.
* **🚩 Milestone:** Finalized MVP feature list (What is the *one* thing the app must do?).

## 🎨 Phase 2: Architecture & Pseudo Code

**Timeline:** Weeks 5 – 7 (Feb 9 – Feb 27)
**Goal:** Design the logic and data structure.

* **Tasks:**
* [ ] Sketch UI wireframes (Figma or Pen/Paper).
* [ ] Write **Pseudo Code** for the core scheduling logic.
* [ ] Set up GitHub Repo and Dev Environment.
* [ ] *Holiday Note:* Feb 16 (Presidents Day) — No Classes.


* **Professor Focus:** Reviewing data schemas and logic flow for efficiency.
* **🚩 Milestone:** "App Skeleton" complete (Navigation is functional; UI is ready for data).

## 💻 Phase 3: MVP Development (The Build)

**Timeline:** Weeks 8 – 10 (Mar 2 – Mar 20)
**Goal:** Build the functional core of the application.

* **Tasks:**
* [ ] **Week 8:** Build data input forms (Class times, homework deadlines).
* [ ] **Week 9:** Build the "Dashboard" view (What does the student see first?).
* [ ] **Week 10:** Implement notification/reminder logic.
* [ ] *Note:* Mar 20 (No Classes) — Use for deep-focus coding.


* **Professor Focus:** Code reviews, debugging roadblocks, and architectural best practices.
* **🚩 Milestone:** Functional MVP (The app "works" even if it isn't pretty yet).

* [ ] **Debugging:** Spend 5 hours fixing "critical" bugs found in testing.
* [ ] **Marketing:** Draft a promotion plan (e.g., "Complete 5 tasks, get a Crumbl cookie" milestone incentives).
* [ ] **Learning:** Watch tutorials on App Store deployment or Web hosting (Vercel/AWS).


* **Professor Focus:** Security, scalability, and preparing for final submission.
* **🚩 Milestone:** App deployed to a test environment/web and ready for users.
